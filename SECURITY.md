# Reporting Security Issues

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/jamessawle/java-lambda/security/advisories/new) tab.

A response will be sent indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, you will be kept informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
